For the past 2 months I have been working on a Clustered Renderer for the PlayStation 5 with the aim to learn more about rendering techinques and PlayStation's AGC API. Throughout this blog post I will share my findings about my research and implementation of the Clustered Rendering algorithm. Unfortuantely I can't share the source code of my project because AGC is a closed source API under an NDA. Even though that's the case I will share some pseudo code relevant to the subject. So let's get to it!
